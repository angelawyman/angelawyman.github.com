How do you define yourself?\r\nWould you include User Interface designer, Information Architect, Interaction Designer, User Experience, Usability expert, as part of your description?\r\n\r\nHistorically, I never had to worry about calling myself a typesetter, prepress work, rubylith cutter, retoucher, copy writer, photostat machine operator, paste up and mechanical artist, color separator, press checker, illustrator, advertising executive, art director, binder, archivist; because calling myself a graphic designer pretty much covered all of those when I worked in print. \r\n\r\nWelcome to the hybrid approach to the web.\r\n\r\nWilson Miner on this topic\r\nhttp://vimeo.com/7835308\r\n\r\nRyan Singer also on this topic\r\nvimeo.com/15083781\r\n\r\nBryan Dewan I Can See filmstrip on mechanicals\r\n\r\n\r\nignore the rest of this----\r\n$ cd your_repo_root/repo_name\r\n$ git fetch origin\r\n$ git checkout gh-pages\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you're using the GitHub for Mac, simply sync your repository and you'll see the new branch.\r\n\r\nAfter publishing your page, you can revisit the page generator and switch to another theme. Your Page content will be preserved if it remained markdown format.\r\n\r\n### Rather Drive Stick?\r\nIf you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named `gh-pages` to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator written by our own Tom Preston-Werner. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nYou can @mention a GitHub username to generate a link to their profile. The resulting `<a>` element will link to the contributor's GitHub Profile. For example: In 2007, Chris Wanstrath (@defunkt), PJ Hyett (@pjhyett), and Tom Preston-Werner (@mojombo) founded GitHub.\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nHaving trouble with Pages?
