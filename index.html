        <p>Do you call yourself a web designer?
Do you call yourself a web developer?</p>

<p>What do you think are the differences between these two designations? How do you define yourself?
Would you include User Interface designer, Information Architect, Interaction Designer, User Experience, Usability expert, as part of your description?</p>

<p>Historically, I never had to worry about calling myself a typesetter, prepress work, rubylith cutter, retoucher, copy writer, photostat machine operator, paste up and mechanical artist, color separator, press checker, illustrator, advertising executive, art director, binder, archivist; because calling myself a graphic designer pretty much covered all of those when I worked in print. </p>

<p>Welcome to the hybrid approach to the web.</p>

<pre><code>
If you're using the GitHub for Mac, simply sync your repository and you'll see the new branch.

After publishing your page, you can revisit the page generator and switch to another theme. Your Page content will be preserved if it remained markdown format.

### Rather Drive Stick?
If you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named `gh-pages` to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator written by our own Tom Preston-Werner. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.

### Authors and Contributors
You can @mention a GitHub username to generate a link to their profile. The resulting `&lt;a&gt;` element will link to the contributor's GitHub Profile. For example: In 2007, Chris Wanstrath (@defunkt), PJ Hyett (@pjhyett), and Tom Preston-Werner (@mojombo) founded GitHub.
